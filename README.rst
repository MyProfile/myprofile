MyProfile intends to provide a solution for managing the numerous
accounts and profiles that users have on the Internet. Its main 
purpose is to provide a unified user account, or simply ‘user profile’, 
which as opposed to current ‘silo’ profiles, would really be under 
the user’s control, on a device controlled by the user.

Installation 
------------

To install MyProfile, either clone the repository to your www dir (not recommended), or download the zip generated by GitHub.
Next, simply point your browser to the install file: http://example.com/install.php and provide the required information.

Don't forget to check the Wiki for info on how to install your own CA: https://github.com/MyProfile/myprofile/wiki

External Dependencies
------------

OpenSSL: MyProfile relies on OpenSSL to generate certificates. This means that you have to set up your own CA (Certification Authority). I have created a Wiki page on GitHub with more information on how to create the CA. To include the WebID URI inside the certificate, you need to have a special directive in the openssl.cnf file. These are the extra lines to be added:

::

    SAN = ""
    san = $ENV::SAN
    
  
MySQL: All personal messages and wall messages are stored in a MySQL database, which means you need to have access to a MySQL server.

php-curl: MyProfile uses php-curl for the semantic pingback protocol. Please not that you may also have to install the curl application itself (on debian systems: apt-get install curl).
    

Internal Dependencies
---------------------

These dependencies come bundled with MyProfile. You can update them on your own, but I will try to keep them up to date as much as I can.

ARC2 - https://github.com/semsol/arc2

EasyRdf - https://github.com/njh/easyrdf

Graphite - http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk/

libAuthentication - https://github.com/melvincarvalho/libAuthentication

Important note regarding libAuthentication: if you want to use a different IdP, you will have to edit the file `lib/libAuthentication/lib/Authentication_X509CertRepo.php' and add the IdP's certificate in (PEM form) to the array of IdPs.

Documentation
-------------

At this point, the only existing documentation is the commented code. Until proper documentation will be available, do not hesitate to contact me with questions.

Disclaimer
---------
I'm haven't tested MyProfile under Windows yet.
