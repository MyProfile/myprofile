MyProfile intends to provide a solution for managing the numerous
accounts and profiles that users have on the Internet. Its main 
purpose is to provide a unified user account, or simply ‘user profile’, 
which as opposed to current ‘silo’ profiles, would really be under 
the user’s control, on a device controlled by the user.

Installation 
------------

To install MyProfile, either clone the repository to your www dir (not recommended), or download the zip generated by GitHub.
Next, simply point your browser to the install file: http://example.com/install.php and provide the required information.


External Dependencies
------------

OpenSSL: MyProfile relies on OpenSSL to generate certificates. This means that you have to set up your own CA (Certification Authority). I have created a wiki page with more information on how to create the CA. To include the WebID URI inside the certificate, you need to have a special directive in the openssl.cnf file. These are the extra lines to be added:

::

    SAN = ""
    san = $ENV::SAN
    
  
MySQL: All notifications and wall messages are stored in a MySQL database, which means you need to have access to a MySQL server.

php-curl: MyProfile uses php-curl for the semantic pingback protocol. Please not that you may also have to install the curl application itself (on debian systems: apt-get install curl).

Documentation
-------------

At this point, the only existing documentation is the commented code. Until proper documentation will be available, do not hesitate to contact me with questions.

Disclaimer

I'm haven't tested MyProfile under Windows yet.
